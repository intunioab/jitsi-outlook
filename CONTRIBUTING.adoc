[[ways-to-contribute]]
== Ways to Contribute

* Report/fix problems found during installing or developer environments.
* Add suggestions for something else that is missing. 

[[community-guideline]]
== Community Guildeline

Be nice and respectful to each other.

We follow the link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[Contributor Covenant Code Of Conduct].

[[file-issue]]
== File an Issue

Please check briefly if there already exists an Issue with your topic.
If so, you can just add a comment to that with your information instead of creating a new Issue.

=== Report a bug

To report bugs is a good and easy way to contribute.

To do this, open an Issue that summarizes the bug and set the label to "bug".

=== Suggest a feature

To request a new feature you should and summarize the desired functionality and its use case.
Set the Issue label to "feature" or "enhancement".


[[contribute-code]]
== Contribute Code, Documentation and more

You want to contribute code, documentation or 'your fantastic thing x'. 
Great, however, there are some practical points to check to make sure that everything runs as smoothly as possible.

* It is always best to discuss your plans beforehand, to ensure that your contribution is in line with our goals.
* Check the list of open Issues. Either assign an existing issue to yourself, or create a new one that you would like to work on, and discuss your ideas and use cases.
* Follow the projects' convention and style regarding test, code and documentation, commit style etc.
* The project can decide to decline a contribution not following the general project guidelines, or deemed to not fit into the general project goal/architecture.
* Make sure you have an understanding of the link:#pull-request[Pull Request Lifecycle]
* You agree to that in general, all contributions to this project will be released under the **inbound=outbound** norm, that is,
 they are submitted under the same terms as the project licenses. In a more formal way - 'Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of the projects License, without any additional terms or conditions.'
* link:#signoff-and-signing-a-commit[Sign your commits].

[[pull-request]]
== Pull Request Lifecycle

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull-request. 
This workflow is common, maybe even expected if nothing else mentioned, and is called the https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model[Fork-and-Pull model]

A practical example of such a workflow could be:

1 Fork the repository.
2 Create a topic branch from your forks main/master branch, i.e. myfeaturebranch
3 Push your changes to the topic branch (in your fork) of the repository, i.e myfeaturebranch.
4 Open a new pull request to main project.
5 Project maintainers might comment and give feedback on your Pull Request.

[[commit-guideline]]
== Commit Guidelines

=== DCO - Signoff and Signing a Commit

NOTE: Signoff and signing: Two similar terms for two different things + 
**_A Signoff assures to the project that you have the right to contribute your content_** + 
**_A Sign assures that the commit came from you_**

==== Signoff (DCO agree)

A standard practice in the Open Source communities is the https://developercertificate.org/[DCO - Developer Certificate of Origin]. 
It is a lightweight way for a project for extra assurance that the contributor wrote and/or have the right to submit the contribution.

It is supersimple!

As part of filing a pull request you agree to the DCO, by just adding a *sign off*  to your commit.
Technically, this is done by supplying the `-s`/`--signoff` flag:

Example:
[source,shell]
----
$ git commit --signoff -m 'fix: add fix for superbug x'
----

==== Sign

Optionally, you can also sign the commit with `-S`/`--gpg-sign`. 
Besides extra trust, it also gives your commit a nice verified button in the UI on most Git platforms and further assures trust.
It requires that you have a GPG keypair set up, see https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits[Sign commit on GitHub with GPG key]

[source,shell]
----
`$ git commit --signoff --gpg-sign -m "fix: add fix for the bug"`
----

=== Commit Standard

Aim for a clear human readable commit history:

* **_Does the project have a defined commit message practice, please follow that_**. 
* Make sure you link:#dco-signoff-and-signing-a-commitsign-off[Sign-Off] your commits.
* In general
    ** Make commits of logical units.
    ** Your commit messages should tell a human reader what will it do when the commit is applied.
    ** If the project does not have standard for commits, you might want to consider https://www.conventionalcommits.org[Conventional Commit standard].
    ** Make your commit message/s easily human readable in a expected way: +
        *** A Conventional Commit example: +
        _fix: add a null pointer check to MyMethod parameter_ +
        Would be read as 'When this fix is applied it will add a null pointer check to MyMethod parameter'

[[security]]
== Reporting security issues

If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention.

If the vulnerability is a widely known issue, such as one publically known from https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search[NIST/NVD]
it might be okay to file an public Issue.

However, if any uncertainty around this, please **DO NOT** file a public issue, see link:SECURITY.md[Security information] for how to handle this. 

Security reports are *greatly* appreciated.

[[development]]
== Development Guidelines

For a guide on how to get started with Development, see the link:./DEVELOPMENT.md[DEVELOPMENT Guide].

**_Happy contributing!_**
